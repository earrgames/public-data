<$m>Hi there! A while ago I made a post about important changes that might improve the game experience. I would be glad if you could join the discussion and give your opinion about the subjects. Current subjects are Campaign and Challenge mode changes.<&p>PD: I forgot to change the version number in the main menu, but current version is 1.0.2, I apologize for any confusion caused. It'll be changed in next update.<&p>Thanks for your time!<&p>Wishing you all the best,\n\nEmmanuel (earrgames).
