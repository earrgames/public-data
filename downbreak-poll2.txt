<$m>Sorry for the absence, I was updating my old game Into the Gloom and took a bit more than expected... anyway, The new Downbreak version 1.1 is out! it features some changes to the campaign mode, two new items and a reworked tower-end reward system. Some graphics were improved too. And lastly, but not least important, now levels are 100% guaranteed to have a solution from top to bottom. If you encounter any bug, please report in one of the pinned threads. Thanks!<&p>Wishing you all the best,\n\nEmmanuel (earrgames).
