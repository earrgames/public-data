<$m>Seems like we have in-game notification now! This will be specially useful for update discussions; As you migth have realized there is a ton of features which could be added or improved. The main goal is to make the game as rich as custom as possible, this could be the definitive minesweeping experience, and with your valuable feedback we can construct a much better game.<&p>Currently we'll be discussing the minigames aspect, some enjoy them, some don't have patience for them, some simply want a more "classic" feel and want them disable, so I've come with some possible solutions which could benefit a lot from your feedback. If you feel in the mood join us in the discussion thread. Just click the "Details" link above.<&p>Thanks for your time!<&p>Wishing you all the best,\n Emmanuel (earrgames).
